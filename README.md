# Comparative Study of autoregressive and non-autoregressive text to speech models on LJ-Speech dataset with quantitative model evaluations

## 1. Introduction to Text-to-Speech (TTS) Models and Voice AI

### What is a Text-to-Speech Model?
A Text-to-Speech (TTS) model converts textual input into spoken voice output, enabling machines to read out text in a natural and intelligible manner. TTS systems are a core component of Voice AI, a technology that allows machines to understand and generate human-like speech, with applications in virtual assistants, customer service bots, accessibility tools, and more.

### How Text-to-Speech Models Work
Text-to-Speech models:
1. **2-stage-Models**: typically consist of two processing/stage components
    a. **Text Analysis Module**: This module processes and converts raw text into a sequence of linguistic features such as phonemes, prosody, and stress patterns.
    b. **Speech Synthesis Module**: This module takes the sequence of linguistic features and generates corresponding speech waveforms.
2. **single-stage-models**: models that process the end to end text to speech conversion in single architecture 

The TTS pipeline traditionally uses multiple stages, but recent advances in deep learning have enabled end-to-end models that directly map text to audio waveforms. These models are categorized into autoregressive and non-autoregressive models, which we will discuss in detail.

## 2. Autoregressive vs. Non-Autoregressive Models

### Autoregressive TTS Models
Autoregressive models generate speech output sequentially, where each generated frame or token depends on the previously generated ones. This dependency ensures high-quality audio with natural prosody and smooth transitions. However, autoregressive models are slower due to their sequential nature and are prone to issues like error accumulation and exposure bias.

#### Examples of Autoregressive Models:
- **Tacotron 2**: A widely used model that generates mel-spectrograms from text, followed by a vocoder like WaveNet to produce waveforms. [Reference: Wang et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884)
- **WaveNet**: A powerful autoregressive vocoder that generates high-fidelity audio samples. [Reference: van den Oord et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499)

### Non-Autoregressive TTS Models
Non-autoregressive models generate all output frames simultaneously, removing the sequential dependency of autoregressive models. This approach significantly accelerates inference speed and reduces latency, making these models suitable for real-time applications. However, non-autoregressive models can struggle with maintaining natural prosody and may require additional mechanisms to improve expressiveness.

#### Examples of Non-Autoregressive Models:
- **FastSpeech 2**: A model that directly predicts the entire sequence of mel-spectrogram frames in parallel, offering fast and high-quality speech synthesis. [Reference: Ren et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558)
- **Parallel WaveGAN**: A non-autoregressive GAN-based vocoder designed for efficient waveform generation. [Reference: Yamamoto et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11480)

|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|

| **Prosody Quality**        | High-quality, natural prosody            | Often requires additional tuning             |
| **Error Accumulation**     | Susceptible due to sequential dependency | Lower risk due to parallel generation        |
| **Latency**                | Higher                                   | Lower                                        |
| **Model Complexity**       | Simpler structure, but prone to biases   | More complex, requiring additional control   |

## 3. Evaluation of Text-to-Speech Models

Evaluating TTS models involves both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Some key evaluation methods are:

### Quantitative Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Opinion Score (MOS)**: A subjective evaluation metric where human listeners rate the quality of synthesized speech on a scale from 1 to 5.
- **Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD)**: A metric to measure the difference between generated and reference mel-spectrograms.
- **Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ)**: An objective measure to assess the audio quality of synthesized speech.

### Qualitative Evaluation
- **Listening Tests**: Human evaluators assess the naturalness, intelligibility, and expressiveness of synthesized speech.
- **ABX Testing**: Evaluators compare generated samples from different models to determine which one sounds more natural or similar to human speech.

### Reference Studies
- MOS and MCD evaluations in FastSpeech 2 and Tacotron 2: [Ren et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558), [Shen et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884)

## 4. Conclusion

In this comparative study, autoregressive models like Tacotron 2 offer high-quality speech with natural prosody but suffer from slower generation speeds and increased latency. Non-autoregressive models like FastSpeech 2 and Parallel WaveGAN overcome these issues, offering faster synthesis at the cost of prosody quality, which can be mitigated with proper tuning. The choice between autoregressive and non-autoregressive models depends on the specific application requirements, such as real-time processing or high fidelity.
